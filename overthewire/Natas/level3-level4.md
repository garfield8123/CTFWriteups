Leviathan OverTheWire Level 4: [level 4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)

## Level 4 info
There is nothing on this page 

## Answer
View-source:http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org shows us nothing

http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt

Shows us the path /s3cr3t/ that is not allowed for crawlers, which might seem interesting


The s3cr3t/ path looks like an interesting viewing and allows us to see the directory list 
useres.txt seems like an interesting file

http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/useres.txt

It seems /files as index has natas4 credentials
